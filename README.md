# json_parser

Parser for JSON

I started this project for educational purposes.
I wanted to show-case how to write a parser using GNU bison.
And writing a JSON parser seemed like a good idea at the time.
Then I wanted to compare this to writing a parser using [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org).

# Structure

Directories `bison` and `antlr` hold the distinct experiments on how to write a JSON parser using either parser generator.

Directory `common` holds code that is shared between all experiments, namely the C++ representation of a JSON value.

Directories `bison/lesson<N>` hold the distinct lessons on how to write a JSON parser using GNU's Bison and Flex.

Directory `bison/final` holds the final result using GNU's Bison and Flex.
